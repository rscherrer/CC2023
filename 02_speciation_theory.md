## Speciation Theory

In this lecture we ask the question: what are the conditions that are required for new species to form? Many people have tried to come up with answers, and sometimes they are surprising. As always, those problems are tackled by both theoreticians coming up with models, and empiricists trying to confirm or reject those theories.

Darwin's famous theory of evolution by natural selection was first introduced in his book, *On the Origin of Species*. In it, he explains at lengths his arguments for the idea that species change through time, and that all species are related. And yet, he does not answer the question that his title suggested he might set out to answer, that of the origin of species. That species change through time and that they diverged from other species at some point is one thing, but what happened that made those species diverge? Darwin himself admitted the origin of new species to be that "mystery of mysteries", which he could not really crack. 

This has actually been and remained, until today, one of the main angles of attack of creationism against the theory of evolution. Showing that species change through time is relatively easy, and considerable amounts of evidence have accumulated to back this claim up. Or at least, the type of evidence for it is relatively intuitive and close to us: we have evolved our crops and breeds of domestic animals, and we see bacteria evolving resistance to antibiotic treatments. In comparison, the idea that species are all related and split at some point in the past has remained more contentious, mostly because the origin of new species, aka speciation, simply happens much more rarely. The split between humans and chimps is estimated to have happened about 6 Myr ago, for example. But more than that, while Darwin managed to provide a compelling mechanism for the evolution of single lineages, he could not really come up with a concrete mechanism that would explain how a species could give rise to another one. For those reasons, speciation has historically had more trouble to be accepted than just evolution by natural selection --- creationists often accept the latter, but believe that all species were created independently, i.e. they could not have originated from other species (and de factor humans could not have evolved from great ape ancestors).

Speciation is often regarded as the interface between two scales of evolution: microevolution, which refers to evolution that happens on relatively short time scales, and usually within single lineages, and macroevolution, which refers to evolution on much longer geological time scales, along which new species arise (and others go extinct). This distinction is on the one hand historical, with speciation marking the limit of what creationists are willing to accept, but also functional, because as we shall see, the mechanisms that determine the evolution of single species are not the same as those that explain the diversification of entire communities of species (of which speciation is the "entry point"). 

In this lecture, we shall see that speciation is not just any form of evolution, and that a number of requirements must be fulfilled for new species to arise. In other words, the forces that make populations evolve are not necessarily sufficient to promote speciation. Fortunately, evolutionary biologists have spent the last 50 years or so coming up with mechanisms that would explain speciation, and came up with ways to testing their hypotheses, even if speciation is not necessarily something that is easy to see happening. Here, we will cover broadly what they have learned about the conditions under which new species are expected to emerge. 

But first, and like in any talk about speciation, we need to take a little detour and inevitably talk about the species concept. Speciation is the formation of new species. But what is a species? Spoiler: it's complicated. There is consensus, for example, that humans and chimps are two different species. Same for lions and tigers. We recognize them as different discrete "entities" present in nature. There are lions, there are tigers, and there rarely is something in between. But does every discrete entity represent a species? Does someone with green eyes consitute a different species from someone with blue eyes? And also, if all species are related genealogically, then when in the past did the lineage that led to lions become truly a different species from the lineage that led to tigers? Well, to ask what is the nature of what we commonly think of as "species", perhaps it is useful to wonder why we do not find intermediate forms between lions and tigers, for example. People have tried to breed those two species. And they make offspring for sure, that are sort if intermediate in phenotype, but those offspring are sterile. Same for donkeys and horses. And so, this is telling us something about the nature of species: that maybe, those discrete entities are maintained discrete (instead of blending with each other, as we would expect from quantitative genetics) by the fact that they cannot reproduce, or in other terms, because they are reproductively isolated from each other. If you think about it, even if all species are related, it is a given that a walrus cannot reproduce with a fruit fly or that an oak tree cannot reproduce with a sheep. But if you look at species that are more closely related (e.g. lions and tigers) you'll find that they often are partially reproductively isolated.

This realization has led evolutionary biologists to posit that a major driver of the discontinuity we see in nature is because at some point, diverging lineages become reproductively isolated, and that this is what allows them to diverge. And also that therefore, species are ensembles of organisms that are reproductively isolated from other such groups. That is the basis of the "biological" species concept, one of the many definitions of species that are out there. Cause yes, there are more! But why? Isn't it all about reproductive isolation? Well, we have to realize that this definition works well for organisms like horses and tigers, but what about organisms that do not reproduce sexually? Like bacteria or bdelloid rotifers? Most people would undoubtedly accept that there are many "species" of those (e.g. Escherichia coli is a different species that Pseudomonas aeruginosa), but what definition do they use, if, by definition (ahah) those "species" never exchanged genes in the first place (and so never "stopped" doing so)? This is where different species concepts, or definitions, enter the scene: e.g. some that focus on phenotypic or even genetic distance between lineages to consider them different species. More recently, it has been shown with genomic toools that what we thought were good biological species actually keep exchanging genes ("hybridizing") on a regular basis, but remain relatively well delimited (enough that we still count them as different species). This has led some people to argue that a species definition in terms of clusters of genes was more appropriate than using reproductive isolation as a criterion. Needless to say, the debate is still open on species concepts and definitions, and it is pretty much certain that no one definition fits all cases. Each definition has its advantages and its shortcomings, and they all are operational under different circumstances. But the good news in all this is that despite the multiplicity of species definitions, the processes that lead to this discretization of nature tend to apply to many such definitions, regardless of where we put the threshold of when two lineages truly are two species. Of course we need to keep in mind this multiplicity of species definitions, but we can still go about our business of learning about what processes lead to the formation of new species, even if we don't settle on one particular definition.

So, what makes new species? Perhaps the most important realization in this field was that in many cases, closely related species live in different areas. This led some scientists to suggest that geographical isolation between populations of a single species may be a way to get to two separate populations that look different. How so? Well, two separate populations may adapt to different environments, experience different selective pressures, or even just randomly evolve different characteristics under genetic drift. All the evolutionary forces we have seen so far apply here, but one ingredient is key: isolation. The absence of gene flow between the two population is what allows them to undergo different evolutionary routes. This is how you get polar bears in arctic regions and brown bears a bit further South. This works for asexual organisms too: in different places and under different conditions, drift or natural selection may lead populations different directions, to the point we recognize them as different species. But there is more to it in sexual species. Indeed, sometimes geographical isolation is only temporary. And many so-called sister species do share borders, or partially overlap in their range. In those cases, they usually end up like horses and donkeys or lions and tigers, i.e. not being able to reproduce so well. How does that arise?

Perhaps the most classical model of speciation by now is the Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller model. \[Explain the model.\] And so this model not only would explain why isolated populations may evolve in different directions, but why they may have become reproductively isolated if they meet again. And it turns out, many of those genes predicted by the BDM model have been found between closely related species! And so, it sounds like this may be a relatively common way for sexual species to diversify. Note that in its classic form, the model only assumes drift in the two diverging populations. That is to show that incompatibilities can arise through non-adaptive evolution. But it also works if the two populations adapt to different things, and in real life, this is actually likely to happen, if the two populations experience e.g. strikingly different environments.

But wait, so far the model predicts that when the two species come back together, if they reproduce their offspring will have problems. But they still mate, while in the real world, closely related species tend to avoid mating with each other (with some exceptions). How does that evolve? Well, an extension of the model is to predict that when the two populations meet again, the lower fitness of their hybrid offspring introduces a new selective pressure, for some mechanisms of species recognition to evolve. That is, individuals with somehow better abilities to tell apart and mate with their own population, or that have some way of preventing interspecific mating, will be favore by selection, because they will not "waste" offspring by mating with the "wrong" species. And those exist in the real world: many closely related species of damselflies differ in the shape of their copulatory organs, to the point that they are no longer compatible, and many species have evolved mating cues and associated preferences that allow them to discriminate potential mates from their own species.

The evolution of species recognition mechanisms constitutes a different type of reproductive isolation than just the lower fitness of hybrids due to genetic incompatibilities. Here, we talk about prezygotic isolation and postzygotic isolation, depending on where in the life cycle the barrier to gene flow is. Of course, multiple barriers (post pre and postzygotic) can arise during a given speciation event between species, and actually, this is often considered the ultimate step in speciation: two (biological) species are fully separated when they have achieved both pre- and postzygotic reproductive isolation, i.e. they do not mate, and even if they did their offspring would not be viable or fertile.

In the previous example with the BDM model we said that geographical isolation is a key component of speciation because it allows genetic incompatibilities to accumulate, and those cause postzygotic isolation between the diverging species. If the species come back into what is called secondary contact, this can select for the rise of prezygotic isolation measures as a response to postzygotic isolation being in place. (This scenario is called reinforcement.) But does that mean that every speciation event occurs like that? Or could there be other paths to the formation of new species?

To know that, we have to ask ourselves, what other things than geographical barriers may contribute to driving groups of individuals apart in genes, phenotypes, and (for sexual species) result in reproductive isolation. One obvious answer is (natural, although stay tuned) selection. We said earlier, and it should now be clear from previous classes, that different populations experiencing different environments or selective regimes (either in the lab or in nature) will typically evolve different phenotypes and different adaptations. But those populations need not always be geographically separate for this to happen. Take two populations that are in parapatry, i.e. their ranges are neighboring each other and they slightly overlap, such that both populations experience different environments, but there is still gene flow between them: they can, and they do occasionally, reproduce. Note that this would also work in allopatry, i.e. in full geographical isolation, but with occasional migrants moving between the populations. If the two populations experience drastically different environments, and are selected to evolve different adaptations, and that those adaptations are such that there is a trade-off between being adapted to one environment and being adapted to the other (i.e. it is impossible for an individual to just be adapted to both at the same time), then individuals coming from one environment will typically be maladapted in the other. This in itself is a form of reproductive isolation, if maladapted migrants have trouble finding mates because they perform poorly in their environment of arrival (in this case they are "filtered" by the environment). But those migrants may still manage to reproduce occasionally and transfer their genes into the locally adapted population. This will tend to create hybrid offspring that may also be relatively poorly adapted to their local environment, because they inherited genes coming from another population (where they would have been fitter if they had only inherited genes that are adaptive in the local environment). And so, theory predicts that adaptive genes making their way into a population where they become maladaptive will be filtered out, either in the newcomers directly (a form of prezygotic isolation) or through the lower fitness of hybrids (postzygotic isolation). In both cases, divergent selective conditions cause reproductive isolation. And the same applies as before: if hybrids have low fitness, reinforcement may occur and additional prezygotic barriers (e.g. species recognition mechanisms) may evolve, thus completing speciation.

That divergent selection is involved in many cases of speciation is now extremely well established, and perhaps one of the best clues in favor of that is the persistence of gene flow, in the form of hybridization, between species once thought of as "good" biological species. Indeed, recent advances in genomics have revealed that in many cases, fully separate populations widely recognized as separate species keep exchanging genes, occasionally, to this day, but still remain well separate and distinguishable both phenotypically and genetically. This type of cases has justified the use of other species concepts, such as the genotypic cluster species concept, because in those cases one cannot technically talk about biological species, since they are not per se fully reproductively isolated. The message here is that since there are examples of discrete entities not blending into each other despite gene flow occurring, that is telling us that selection must be quite a good at keeping those species apart.

These insights are derived from theoretical models asking: what are the necessary conditions for speciation and reproductive isolation to occur? General rules of thumb emerge: gene flow will tend to homogenize populations (from the principles of population and quantitative genetics), so forces that counteract gene flow will favor divergence. The two main factors are geographical isolation and divergent selection. Both can act together. Multiple means of reproductive isolation can evolve between species, some in response to others (e.g. reinforcement). And if selection is involved, then there must be trade-off to trigger the divergence of two separate forms (otherwise one generalist will evolve that is perfectly adapted to everything).

We said that selection going in opposite directions can create reproductive isolation even between populations that initially exchange genes. We used the example of two neighboring populations in parapatry, but what if selection could also produce new species in full sympatry, that is, within one single population without any geographical barrier? Spoiler alert: it turns out that cases consistent with this scenario are very rare, and the enthusiasm for "sympatric speciation" has died out a bit, but the investigation of this case has given quite some insights into the role of selection on the speciation process (by studying independently of geographical separation). Of course, note that the distinction between sympatric, parapatric and allopatric is always a bit blurry, after all, two parapatric populations may be both ends of one big sympatric population, depending on how you look at it and especially if they exchange genes. To go beyond these artificial categories, modern speciation biologists have switched to talking in terms of "speciation with gene flow". But bear with me for a moment here: in the classical parapatric case, we have gene flow, but we have two environments located in different places, such that individuals experience mostly one environment throughout their lifetime (they need to disperse to experience the other environment). In the purest "sympatric" case, we would assume that both environments, or ecological niches, are present in the same area, such that individuals constantly have access to both. That could be a very patchy and heterogneous landscape made of open areas and areas covered with shrubs, or just the present of two very different food sources in the same habitat, for example. Here, selection favors forms adapted to one or the other niche (i.e. there is a trade-off) may not be enough to trigger speciation into two forms that will subsequently evolve means of spceies recognition. 

To understand why, let us view the problem form a fitness landscape perspective. There must be a trade-off for two species to evolve under divergent selection and in the presence of gene flow, otherwise a generalist adapted to everything will evolve. Here, the trade-off must be particularly strong, because individuals have access to both niches at all times --- so if it is biologically possible why not be adapted to both? It is not unrealistic to expect that there might be strong trade-offs in a situation like this, but a strong trade-off would also mean that the transition between the two niches is very difficult to achieve: any mutant, or hybrid, with intermediate phenotype would de factor suffer strong fitness costs by deviating from either niches, which here a represented as fitness peaks. That is, a strong trade-off that makes it so that individuals can be adapted to one niche or the other but certainly not both, does so by carving a very deep fitness valley  between both niches. Why is that a problem? Well, classical evolutionary theory would predict that selection will lead to whatever change in phenotype that would increase fitness, and here, that would mean climbing whatever side of the valley we are already on and staying there. Sure, a mutant may appear that is on the other side of the valley, but the survival and establishment of that mutant becomes less likely as the trade-off gets stronger. And so, it can be shown in models that speciation by adaptation to different ecological niches in sympatry is difficult, because it requires stronger trade-offs than in parapatry, and those may result in the organism only evolving to adapt to one of the two niches and getting stuck there, thereby leaving the other niche vacant. Unless the population starts exactly at the bottom of the fitness valley, but that seems unreasonable for many reasons: populations are usually reasonably well adapted to a niche or an environment before some new ecological niches becomes available, and it is difficult to envision situations that would place a population at a fitness minimum in a fitness landscape.

Except there is one such situation. In some cases, certain phenotypes are not just inherently bad or good, fit or unfit, but instead, the fitness they give their bearer depends on what other phenotypes are present in the population. Or on the frequencies of the different phenotypes present in the population. That is called frequency-dependent selection, where fitness is no longer a constant but varies with the phenotypic composition of a population. Think about seeds available on an island. (Explain the seed example with depletion of the preferred ones.) It follows that because the fitness of a phenotype changes as the composition of the population changes, fitness landscape are not fixed when selection is frequency-dependent. They change shape through time. And negative frequency-dependent selection (rare advantage, which is the one we are interested in here in the context of speciation), typically turns fitness peaks into fitness valleys once the bulk of a population has reached them. Once everybody has evolve the beak size that is optimal for the most common seed size, that seed size becomes a whole lot less advantageous to feed on: it becomes a fitness valley, and anything that deviates slightly becomes the slopes of a new fitness hill. And there you go: frequency-dependent selection (here caused by competition) can create conditions where a population spontaneously evolves towards a so-called branching point, i.e. a point in phenotype space where selection becomes disruptive. More than that, the population is maintained there by selection until it splits into two morphs (which will then likely evolve means of prezygotic isolation because their hybrids will fall back into the fitness valley). We no longer rely on the population having to be "by chance" exactly at the junction between two niches.

What does that mean for sympatric speciation? That is not clear. The results of those theoretical endeavors seem to suggest that sympatric speciationn is possible, and will be most likely when selection is frequency-dependent, because that solves the paradox imposed by the require strong trade-offs. But does it happen in the wild? There are lots of examples of frequency-dependent selection, but it is not always easy to link them causally to a certain speciation event. More basic problem even than that, it is not easy to confirm whether two species have diverged in sympatry or not. Sure, some sister species have ranges that completely overlap (i.e. they are sympatric at present) and are adapted to different things, such that it very much looks like they diverged in sympatry, but it could be that they diverged in allopatry or parapatry and only later came back into secondary contact and underwent reinforcement. Those two scenarios are very difficult to disentangle, especially if the phase of reinforcement involved gene flow that erased the genomic clues indicative of a phase of divergence in allopatry. But a lot of research is being done on that front to design methods that can tease apart those scenarios based on genetic data.

Nevertheless, the insights gathered from theoretical studies of sympatric speciation teach us something about the balance between natural selection and geographical isolation, and what the former can achieve independently of the latter. Strong natural selection helps to drive species apart, especially so if selection is frequency-dependent, but can also do so if selection is not frequency-dependent, as long as there is some geographical isolation to compensate.

So far we set the stage of theoretical speciation events by saying that geographical isolation or selection offer good starting points for speciation to kick in, and we often said that those forces would eventually (in many cases) lead to the evolution of prezygotic isolation as  response to postzygotic isolation having arisen (i.e. reinforcement). But we remained a bit handwavy about that. How does that work exactly? (More than just saying that if species recognition mechanisms can evolve, they will.)

Reinforcement is about evolving ways of preventing mating. It therefore has to do with mate compatibility or mate choice. And it therefore most likely involves sexual selection. Divergent mating cues, and preferences, between diverging species are a good candidate mechanism to achieve prezygotic isolation, stop mating with the wrong species and making unfit offspring. And many sister species seem to differ in mating cues, and to have preferences for the mating cues of their own species (assortative mating). So, that seems quite clear right? Two populations may have experienced divergent ecological selection, maybe with some geographical isolation, such that two morphs are favored and hybrids are counter selected --- from then, the two populations just need to evolve different mating cues (in males) and preferences (in females), e.g. divergent colors and assortative preferences for those colors, and tadaa! We have to fully reproductively isolated species. But there is a problem, and this problem is recombination.

As we saw in quantitative genetics, many traits are encoded by lots of genes. And chances are that the genes that code for ecological adaptation are different from the genes that code for mating cues and sexual preferences. In asexual species, or in fully allopatry with no gene flow, there is no problem with that. But if divergence occurs in the presence of gene flow (either from the start or upon secondary contact), then we have a problem. That is because mating cues can only evolve and fixate in a population, together with their corresponding preference in females, if they are a reliable indicator of the ecological adaptation of their bearer. Different color patterns will only evolve, for example, if they allow individuals to discriminate "good" and "bad" mates. But when two populations interbreed and exchange genes, if the genes coding for those different traits are different and if there is recombination between them, then all combinations of cues and ecological adaptations will be formed: the red cue will be both found in individuals with one adaptation and in individuals with another adaptation. The cue will therefore lose its predictive ability, and will probably be lost because it does not allow efficient mate choice. There are ways around this apparent paradox. One is that initial, random associations between alleles (due to drift) may cause sufficient linkage disequilibrium between cues and ecological adaptations for divergence to kick off and cues to be good-enough indicators of ecotype, but that does not always work and it becomes more and more difficult as the number of loci involved increases. Another is what we call "magic traits", a form of pleiotropy (when the same genetic elements code for different phenotypes) --- what if the same genes were both involved in ecological adaptation and reproductive isolation? That may sound weird, but there are examples of traits that could qualify out there. For example, the choice of host plant to breed and feed on in a phytophagous insect. Adapting to a new host plant (e.g. through a battery of metabolic genes) will lead to a new population to breed on that new host plant, thereby never encountering again members of its ancestral population: prezygotic isolation is achieved automatically through ecological adaptation. Or imagine a bird species where females prefer males with more red in their plumage (red comes from carotenoids, which comes from food, so it serves as an indicator of ecological performance and foraging abilities in a bunch of bird species), but two neighboring populations of these birds experience very different environments with different food sources available. Divergent selection may lead to different phenotypes evolving in parapatry here, but on both sides, whoever is fit will be red in their local environment (because they can best exploit it) but not if they migrate to the other habitat, which they are not adapted to. They will therefore hardly find a mate there. In that sense, because of some common and homogeneous sexual preference preexisting in the population, the trait that diverges and allows for ecological adaptation also automatically leads to prezygotic isolation --- it is a magic trait. 

Yet a third possibility for the joint evolution of ecological divergence and prezygotic isolation mechanisms is through the "forcing" of linkage disequilibrium between both kinds of loci. We are no longer talking about magic traits here, but imagine if some genetic mechanism could ensure that the genes for color pattern were inherited consistently together with the genes for ecological adaptation (i.e. what if they were in strong linkage?). Well, that happens sometimes, and it involved mechanisms that suppress, or strongly reduce, recombination between those genes. One common way that has been described in nature is through chromosomal inversions: when bits of chromosome are just inverted along the genomic sequence. The consequence off that is that inverted copies of a sequence typically no longer recombine with their homologous counterpart in a diploid genome, because recombination requires the physical alignment of the sequences to work. No alignment, no recombination. No recombination, full linkage. Of course, recombination exists and is advantageous for lots of reasons (which we will not cover here) so we should not expect inversions to link together genes that are very, very far away. But it happens that sometimes recombination is suppressed in regions within chromosomes, locking together genes involved in ecological adaptation and assortative mating, as in Heliconius butterflies. When recombination stops and many genes become locked together, their alleles inherited as a single haplotype, we call that a supergene. 

Now, although some examples of supergenes or magic traits have been identified, in the vast majority of cases we just have no idea how prezygotic isolation has evolved between the species. It is also rarely clear how much ecological divergent selection has operated, and whether it was frequency-dependent or not. And we said already, it is not clear usually how much gene flow was involved. Those questions usually represent the bulk of questions that speciation researchers aim at answering for any particular speciation event their are studying. That, and identifying the genes that are involved in the process --- speciation genetics and genomics. And all that uncertainty is because speciation is (1) a complicated phenomenon, which can be affected by many factors and requires a few things to be in place in order to work out, and (2) it has usually happened in the past and we can only gather clues and evidence for what has happened. In that sense, speciation probably qualifies as a crime scene reconstruction even more so than just evolution, because while evolution sill goes on, by definition speciation events are bounded in time. We can only get indirect evidence for what has happened.

That sounds quite complete. Do I have more to say?

* Should I include speciation genetics and genomics here or do they deserve a full lecture? Or a practical? Maybe I could use the practicals to teach them about Haldane's rule, clines, speciation genomics, etc.
* Some terms are missing: adpative speciation, ecological speciation, peripatric and vicariant speciation, polyploid speciation, hybrid speciation
* Mention famous examples such as cichlids, anoles, sticklebacks, Rhagoletis etc.
