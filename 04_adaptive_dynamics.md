## Adaptive Dynamics

In this lecture we will learn about a mathematical modeling framework used to study evolutionary problems and predict the outcome of selection. Adaptive dynamics expands beyond population genetics and quantitative genetics in its ability to encompass more ecologically-realistic scenarios.

* Over the course of this crash course we have seen multiple ways in which we could conceptualize evolutionary problems and gain insights into them. In population genetics we have seen that based on a number of parameters and assumptions we can predict the changes in frequencies of alleles under various evolutionary forces. In quantitative genetics, we have seen that parameters like heritability and selection gradiients could help us make predictions about the short-term evolution of a quantitative trait. Here, we are gonna go over another useful framework of evolutionary theory, called adaptive dynamics.

* Adaptive dynamics is a conceptual framework, i.e. a way to think about evolution that is not really how evolution works but is a useful approximation for some questions nevertheless. Just like population genetics and quantitative genetics are approximations of how the world really works. So, what kind of approximation (or model) of reality is this adaptive dynamics business and wwhat can it be useful for?

* In population genetics and quantitative genetics we have used a lot morphological or physiological or disease traits as examples. Let us use a behavior here. [Introduce an example with prairie dogs or meercats with different degrees of vigilance. Explain that vigilance is something that can evolve.] The question we are asking is: wwhat degree of vigilance will evolve under natural selection? Intuitively, we would say: well, that depends, there is a trade-off there, because increased vigilance lowers the risks of predation but also reduces the time spent foraging and accumulating resources. And vice versa ofc. So, it seems like some intermediate level of vigilance is optimal, and may be favored by selection. But can we say anything more than that?

* Let us conceptualize this problem in a mathematical model. [Do that and show how to derive the optimal vigilance level hen seleciton is frequency independent.]

* [Then say but wait! The payoff of a level of vigilance maybe depends on what others are doing. Introduce the concept of freqnecu dependent selecction. Say that if this is the case then wwe have to modify our conceptual model. Show that wee can no think of the problem like a gam --- introduce game theory, Nash equilibrium, ess.]

* [On the side, mention other famous games in game theory such as hawk-dove or the prisoner's dilemma. Game theory is about figuring out what are the optimal strategies to play in such games. And by doing tthat we sommetimes find interesting insights about real world situations, with applications e.g. in gambling, economics or thee natural world (e.g. the evolution of cooperation).]

* We just made our first step into adaptive dynamics. From here, it is possible to systematically study this kind of model we came up with to describe the "rules" tthat determine fitness in our hypothetical meercat example. Let us assume a fitness function of a mutant in a resident strategy bla bla. For any mutant we can calculate, given some parameters f the fitness function, how well it does against hte resident. That is called an invasion analysis. And the result of an invasion analysis can be viewed in a pairwise invasibility plot. [Showw example ith vigilance levels. Explain howw to read a pip.]

* The key ingredient here is the fitness function, called invasion fitness. We hve to come up with it ourselves, and hope that it describes appropriately enough the syystem we are trying to represent. It is common to start wwith building a life cycle for the virtual organism, and then think about how it would differ beteween mutan and resident, sometimes making simplifications. It may be important to see if the insights we get differ when we change the details of the fitness function.

* [Explain tthe different kinds of equilibria, or singularities, that can arise in a pip.]

* [Explain that the prediction of the long-term outcome can be done more systematically than looking at a graph by computing the selection gradient. Also explain that singularities should be poitns wwhere the selection gradient equals zero. Then explain that we can use criteria for convergence stability and evolutionary stability.]

* So what makes an adaptive dynamics analysis? we use it when we have a question about the long-term evolution of a trait under selection. To get insights into that question, we need to formulate the problem in terms of mathematical equations: equations for the life cycle of the organism arre a good start, because we can derive popultion growth rates and fitness from those. But there are lots of ways in which fitness can be defined, and it is up to us to chose a formulation of fitness that we think is good enough. (We may use several different ones and compare hat the predictions are.) The fitness function that we come up with reflects the ecology of our species of interst, or at least, the part of its ecology that the trait e are concerned about is affecting. In that sense, adaptive dynamics is much more focused on ecology than other evolutionary frameworks like pop gen or qg --- it allows to explore eevolutionary problems with intricate ecological situations and dynamics (it all depends on the fitness function). From there, the recipe is always the same: studying the problem with pips, computing selction gradeints, finding singularitie and evaluating their stability, regardless of the organism,, evolving trait or fitness function at hand. This is where the framework really is. Of course this versatility in terms of ecological situations is done at the expense of realism in terms of the genetic underpinnings of the trait: in this framework a hidden assumption is often that the trit is coded by a single haploid locus with an infinite amount of continuously valued alleles. But we also assume monomrphic populations to simplify the maths, and replacement of mutant by slightly better ones. We also assume small mutational steps and a distinction of time scales. All of these assumptions make the analysis easier to perform, or even feasible at all. But of course they come at a cost of realism. Natural populations exhibit genetic variation, for one. Then, many traits (especially complex ones) are encoded by many many genes in complicated ways. And many argue that eco-evolutionary processes unfold on similar timescales. Of course, as we shall see in the lecture on the philosophy of modeling, models are approximations of reality, and their usefulness depends on the assumptions we make and what we chose to approximate. One can argue that the adaptive dynamics approach makes better choices regarding the ecology of a species, allowwing for fitness to be frequency-dependent for example, in intricate ways. Noww, it is also important to realize that just because the assumptions of a model are unrealistic, doesn't mean that the model cannot be used to learn new things. That adaptive dynamics assumes a monomorphic population does not mean that it cannot describe the evolution of a population with genetic variation. It is common in theoretical papers investigating the adaptive dynamics of this or that system to complement their adpative dynamics analysis wwith stochastic simulationss of the same process, to see whether the predictions of the model are robusst to violations of its assumptions. This is a common issue also in statistics where many datasets do violate to some extent the asssumptions of the tests that are being applied to them: now it turns out that some assumptions are less "bad" wwhen violated. Ofc there is no guarantee off that, andd one would need to conduct a proper robustness study to verify hich assumptions of the model are absolutely critical for its predictions and which ones less so, and it may still depend on wwhich exact problem we are modeling, or howw we violate each assumption specifically. In general, butthat is outof the scope of thi lecture so I should stop here, wwe should always take the predictions of our models with a grain of salt: that includes adaptive dynamics. Yet, its predictiosn have been shown to also be met in simulations that relax the strict assumptiosn it makes. (Also there is no drift even though the population may be ffinite.) 

* Now what is important to remmember here, and perhaps a more useful wway of thinking about this approach, is that the goal of adaptive dynamics  is not so much to predict what evolution will do (that depends on lots of factors that are abstracted away in the ad analysis) but more: wwhat would it do under the influecne of selection alone (hecne the name). What is thee nature of the adaptive landscape our ppopulation is evolving through? Where is selection ppushing it? Whether the population will acctually followw that predicted path depends on external constraints and factors such as drift or the details of the genetic architecture of the traits. Adaptive dynamics is then about mapping what selection would ideally have our population do.

* This type of modeling approach can give us important insights in howw evolution worls, andd in a number of times its predictiosn have been shown to also be met in simulations that relax the strict assumptiosn it makes. Here are a fw examples of applications. [Keep examples brief?]
