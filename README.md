Scripts for my lectures at the Crash Course in Evolutionary Biology 2023.

## Content summary

### [Evolutionary Quantitative Genetics](01_evolutionary_quantitative_genetics.md)

Population genetics theory focuses on predicting what will happen to one or a handful of genes at most, whose alleles have discrete effects on the phenotype. But what of traits that vary continuously in populations (such as body size) and that may be encoded by many, many genes? Here, we will see how quantitative genetics extends the principles of population genetics to those cases, and gives us tools to understand and predict the evolution of phenotypes... sometimes without really needing to know the underlying genes.

### [Speciation Theory](02_speciation_theory.md)

In this lecture we ask the question: what are the conditions that are required for new species to form? Many people have tried to come up with answers, and sometimes they are surprising. As always, those problems are tackled by both theoreticians coming up with models, and empiricists trying to confirm or reject those theories.

### [Speciation Genetics and Genomics](03_speciation_genetics_and_genomics.md)

We have covered under which conditions speciation should happen. But what are the genetic changes that allow speciation to unfold once those conditions are met? In this lecture we will cover the genetic mechanisms that are behind the formation of new species. We will also go beyond that in looking at how we can use tools from genetics and genomics to learn a thing or two about how speciation happened.

### [Phylogenetics and Beyond](04_phylogenetics_and_beyond.md)

In this part of the course we will go over phylogenetic trees: what they are, how to read them and why should we care about them. We will see that they can be used to ask evolutionary questions that go beyond just the genealogical relationship between species, such as whether there is a limit to species diversification, or whether mating system affects the evolution of plumage color in birds.

### [Adaptive Dynamics Theory](05_adaptive_dynamics_theory.md)

Sometimes, as hopefully we will have seen in all the other lectures, there are so many selection pressures affecting organisms that it is difficult to predict what path evolution will take. What is the optimal sex ratio for a given population? What behavioral strategy should be favored in this or that case? Is a certain environment prone to speciation? Here, we will how adaptive dynamics theory gives us tools to get insights into those questions.

### [The Philosophy of Models](06_the_philosophy_of_models.md)

Evolutionary biology is heavily driven by a back-and-forth between theoreticians who make models about how they think the world works, and empiricists looking for clues to confirm or reject those theories (some times even the two are the same person). But why do we so often bother with mathematical models when we could have used verbal models (like Darwin's basic statement that species evolve)? Here, we will learn about what models are, where they can take us, and why different modelling techniques are used for different purposes.
